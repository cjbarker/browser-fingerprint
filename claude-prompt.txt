Create a browser fingerprinting server-side code in golang that creates a universally unique fingerprint based on the requester.  The server-side should analyze the requestors information such as HTTP headers, IP address and more to uniquelly identify the requester.  The server should receive the client requests aggregate calculate the fingerprint and return it to standard out.  The requests should be idempotent meaning the same unique fingerprint should be returned for a given requester assuming the set of inputs do not change.  If the input changes such as a HTTP header than a new unique fingerprint should be generated.
